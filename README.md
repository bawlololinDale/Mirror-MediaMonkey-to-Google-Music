#mm2gm: sync MediaMonkey to Google Music

Built on [gmusicapi](https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API), this project aims to sync a MediaMonkey library to Google Music.

Since I'm planning to use only the MediaMonkey database, an effort will be made to keep the implementation mediaplayer-agnostic. That way, other mediaplayers with a similar sqlite database could be synced as well.

The project is not supported nor endorsed by Google.
